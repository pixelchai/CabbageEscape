Concept:
Cabbage Escape
Start off in a bowl -- want to escape
Infinitely long plane
randomly spawned carrot obstacles
(some will fall over)
Try to get as far as you can without crashing into a carrot
Always going forward
Banana powerup (maybe clear the way)

Inspiration:
Following Brackeys tutorial - got up to E05 before ignore lol
he named something "Obstacle" - I shortened it to "Obst" = fruit in German
